# Coffee Price

**Let's write a function `calculate_coffee_price` to calculate the price of a coffee drink!**

### There are 3 different types of coffee, each with a different base price
* Drip, $1.50
* Latte, $3.70
* Cappuccino, $3.20

### Bigger sizes of coffee apply a multiplier to the base price
* Small, base price
* Medium, base price X 1.3
* Large, base price X 1.6
